WordPress Easy Index will create an table of contents for your WordPress Blog posts

== Description ==

WordPress Easy Index is changed to WordPress Easy Contents. Go to the plugin page to download it: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-easy-contents/

For example:
You write a post with several h2 headings. When I've written a long post with a lot of h2 headings I always added manually a short table of contents with anchor links to the headings at the top of the post. A long time consuming process and I'd rather do it automatically: with WordPress Easy Contents.
See this example in the post about Easy Index on my blog.
